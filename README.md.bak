-----------------------------------------------------

There are many "patchable" audio synthesizers, including Moog, Buchla, Paia, and many more
from the 1970's and on. Many of those early systems were incompatible with each other,
using different voltage and control levels, so it was difficult to use them together.
Doepfer created the A-100 System, on which Eurorack is based, for a more open
framework where different manufacturers or designers could add modules to the
system to personalize it. EuroRack has become very popular for modular synthesizers. 

This repository contains Open Source Hardware Reference Designs for EuroRack (Legacy 1.0)
that anyone can use or fabricate for themselves.
